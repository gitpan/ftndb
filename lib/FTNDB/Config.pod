=head1 NAME

FTNDB::Config - Fidonet/FTN SQL Database application configuration.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is in regard to configuration of the application for the administration
of databases for Fidonet/FTN related processing. The SQL database engine is one for which a
DBD module exists, defaulting to SQLite.


=head1 CONFIGURATION

Configuration information that is not provided by the command line options is
obtained from a configuration file.  That can be defined by setting the
"-c" option, which is the path and file name of the configuration file
to be used. If that is not defined, it looks for a file named ftndb.cfg
in the current directory. The file contains configuration items listed
outside of a named section as well as those listed within a named section,
and blank lines and lines starting with a "#" are ignored.

The first items in the file are those outside of a named section:

=over 4

=item LogFile

This is the rquired filename and path of a log file.

=back

The B<Database> section in the configuration file has the following
keywords:

=over 4

=item Type

Database type.
This needs to be a database type for which a DBD module exists, the type
being the name as used in the DBD module.  The default type is SQLite.

=item Name

Database name.
For an SQLite database; this needs to be at least the filename and can
also include a path.

=item User

Database user.
For an SQLite database, this defaults to an empty string as it is not
needed for that type of a database.

=item Password

Database password.
For an SQLite database, this defaults to an empty string as it is not
needed for that type of a database.
